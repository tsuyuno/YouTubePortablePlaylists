A Google Chrome extension popup programs of live.nicovideo.jp you subscribing.

## Description

If you want to check programs on the air you subscribing, click "favorites" displayd on header. However, "favorites" is total bullshit. Why only display 5 items per click? Open live.nicovideo.jp just for checking broadcasted programs is real pain in the arse as well.
